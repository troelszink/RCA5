# READ THIS BEFORE TESTING OUR SOLUTIONS

There are 5 major topics divided into 6 mains. They are as follows:

- mainAI-FC.cpp         - Main for Fuzzy Control
- mainAI-QL.cpp         - Main for Q-Learning
- mainVIS.cpp           - Main for image analysis with Computer Vision
- mainROB-WF.cpp        - Main for Robotics, Wavefront Planner
- mainROB-BF.cpp        - Main for Robotics, Brushfire Algorithm and the GVD
- mainROB-Loc.cpp       - Main for Robotics, Localization

These mains are located in the folder: /robot_control/src/mains/
However, in /robot_control/src there are one main, and the rest are in "mains".
This is the main-file that will be executed when building the project.
Therefore, the main you will like to execute should be moved to: /robot_control/src and renamed to "main.cpp". Move the old main-file into the "mains"-folder and renamed it according to the name definitions above.

Hope you like our project!
